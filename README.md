### Day 36: August 5, 2019:

**Progress:**
- working on *Classification of Motor Imagery Tasks based on BCI Paradigm*

*todays Motivation : I want to pursue machine learning as a career but not sure if I am qualified. How can I test myself?* 
***answer  Andrew Ng :**
*You are qualified for a career in machine learning! Whatever your current level of knowledge, so long as you keep working hard and keep learning, you can become expert in machine learning and have a great career there.

*To anyone interested in the field, start with learning to program. When youâ€™ve mastered the basics of programming, consider the Machine Learning course (Machine Learning | Coursera), then the Deep Learning specialization (deeplearning.ai).

*To go even further, read research papers (follow ML leaders on twitter to see what papers theyâ€™re excited about). Even better, try to replicate the results in the research papers. Trying to replicating othersâ€™ results is a one of the most effective but under-appreciated ways to get good at AI. Also consider activities like online ML competitions, academic conferences, and keep reading books/blogs/papers.

*Itâ€™s really not a matter of whether youâ€™re qualified do work in machine learningâ€”Iâ€™m sure you are! Itâ€™s just a matter of getting the learnings to make yourself more and more qualified.*
